I need you to recreate this 7-page website: https://fromyfarm.app/ as a modern Next.js application with the following specifications:

**Tech Stack:**

**Specific Requests:**
- Analyze the original website's structure and content

Please start by analyzing the website structure and then build the complete Next.js application with the modern glassmorphism aesthetic.
Focus on home page (/) first if the project is large
Use tailwind.config.js for the glassmorphism theme
